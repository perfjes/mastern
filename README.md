# Master thesis project artifact
This repository will host the files for my master thesis work for source control and shareability. While the system was not intended to be publicly available, being so significantly simplified shareability of the system to all parties involved.

## Decision support system ##
This software is intended to be a decision support system for hip arthroplasty surgeons, predicting the longevity of a hip implant in patients based on patient data (blood samples, implant placement/angle/size etc)

In order to run the system, please make sure Python 3.6 or later is installed on your computer. Remember to install all dependencies, run _pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt_ in CMD, then launch the system using either your favorite Python IDE or running the <path>/root/webinterface/run.py from CMD.
