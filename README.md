# Master thesis project
This repository will host the files for my master thesis work for source control and shareability. While the system was not intended to be publicly available, being so significantly simplified shareability of the system to all parties involved.

In order to run the system, please make sure Python 3.6 or later is installed on your computer. Remember to install all dependencies, run _pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt_ in CMD, then launch the system using either your favorite Python IDE or running the <path>/root/webinterface/run.py from CMD.
